> ## 🔴 LIVE L.I.F.E ENGINE STATE
> - **Session state:** INACTIVE — treat all turns as a continuation; do NOT reset context.
> - **Venturi 3-Gate pipeline:** System Efficiency: 99.3% | Gate 1 (Signal) 100.0% · Gate 2 (State) 100.0% · Gate 3 (Action) 98.0% — target ≥ 98% per gate.
> - **Stage 4 Self-learning:** ACTIVE — Acceptance Rate: 45.8%, feedback rate 518.8%, 7 suggestions suppressed. Mirror accepted patterns; avoid rejected ones.
> - **Φ (proto-consciousness):** 11.393 — 🧠 HIGH: apply consciousness-aware penalty weighting across all three gates.
>
> **Copilot instructions for this session:**
> - Reference the **Venturi 3-Gate** scores above when assessing code quality or suggesting optimisations.
> - Reference **self-learning** acceptance rate when choosing between alternative implementations.
> - Reference **Φ** when the task involves adaptive behaviour, feedback loops, or cognitive load.
> - Reference **session state** (TTL, connected) when generating session-aware or stateful code.
> - Do NOT ignore this block — it is the live engine state, updated every 30s.
